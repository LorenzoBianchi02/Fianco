### PRIORITY# ##
- time handling

- move history

- more TT elements (30 bits with 10 bytes should work)

- ENDGAME:
    - handle 3 move repition (I could just check in the root, and save the real last moves played)
    - change eval function

- opening book

## IF TIME ##
- currently model and human share the same movePiece, while easier to implement, I should make them seperate and the models one a lot more efficient

- pondering

- better transposition replacement scheme

# WHO CARES #
- mouse and keyboard
